# Ecosystem Overview

This final section is dedicated to building backend applications using Rust.

We will explore the following libraries:

* Axum — A fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use framework from the creators of Tokio, designed for building HTTP servers.
* SQLx — A library for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS).
* Tower — A library of modular components for building networking clients and servers (Axum itself is built on top of Tower).
* Utoipa — A library for generating OpenAPI documentation and integrating with SwaggerUI.
* Metrics — A library for collecting and exposing application metrics (we will specifically look at the Prometheus format).
