# Preface

## About the Book

The goal of this online book is to help experienced developers quickly master building back-end applications in Rust.

First, we will thoroughly get acquainted with the language itself. Then we will explore the standard project management tool — Cargo. After that, we will study the key components and techniques required for back-end development. Next, we will dive into Rust’s asynchronous capabilities and, finally, learn how to build full-fledged back-end applications.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for developers who already know how to program in other languages and want to quickly “get up to speed” with Rust.

The primary target audience is back-end engineers who write in languages such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, or Go and are dissatisfied with the performance or resource consumption offered by their current language.

It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with:

* integers and floating-point numbers
* arithmetic and logical operations
* basic imperative programming constructs: `if`, `for`, `switch`, functions
* basic data structures: array, list, hash table, tree
* basic algorithms: sorting and searching
* program memory organization: stack and heap
* basic command-line usage
* multithreading and synchronization mechanisms
* the HTTP protocol
* relational databases
* the JSON format

## About the Text

While writing this book, the author aimed to save the reader’s time as much as possible. Therefore, chapters that describe well-known concepts (such as primitive data types, variables, the `if` conditional operator, etc.) are intentionally written briefly and at a high level. At the same time, all Rust-specific material is covered in detail.

The book aims to stay close to the programmer’s perspective, so it contains plenty of anglicisms and professional jargon.

## From the Author

I tried to write the text in a simple and clear way, but I probably didn’t succeed everywhere. If you find a typo, inaccuracy, or feel that something could be phrased better, please let me know by email: rust.for.backend.developers@gmail.com
